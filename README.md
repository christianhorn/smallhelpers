## What's this?

Helper scripts.

  available for bumblebee-status, I use it in the menu line in the Sway
  window manager

  one is not using pcp-pmda-summary

  the energy consumption.  This is to be executed on a 'control system',
  which has Ansible-engine installed.
* openmetrics: scripts for pmda-openmetrics
* pmda-denki-handbook: moved to 
  [here in html](https://fluxcoil.net/files/pmda-denki-handbook-publish/denki.html)
